PickItUp: See that block?  Pick it up!

PickItUp allowes you to pick up and transport most blocks, including complex
ones like chests and furnaces.


While sneaking, right click with an empty hand will pick up a block.  While you
hold the block, you will not be able to stop sneaking, switch to another hotbar
slot, or move the block in your inventory.
(If you find a way around these safeguards, the block will be placed in world
 and the item will decay in your inventory.)

Right clicking again will place the block.  Don't forget that you're sneaking!
Open your doors BEFORE you Pick It Up!


This mod uses a whitelist to determine what blocks can be picked up.  By
default, the list contains all vanilla blocks that drop themselves when mined
with a stone pick (or an empty hand).  Note that this means you can move dirt
and cobblestone, but not grass or smooth stone.

Nearly all mod blocks should transport just fine, but will need to be added to
the whitelist.  As always, take a backup of your world (or be ready to lose it)
before testing anything new, just to be safe.
